DIDemo.Syntax.hungry?()

# Steps to building a taco
# hungry? - > yes or no
# if yes, get tacos...if no, ask if they want something to drink
# for tacos, get tortilla preference (corn, flour, hard shell)
# if corn/flour -> move on to meat preferences
# if hard shell -> kill it, we aint got none of that nonsense (or try again? lol )
# meat preferences -> asada, al pastor, fajitas, veggies (rajas con queso - yummmm)
# the re-use for String.downcase and String.trim on input can be moved to its own function to avoid repetition -> DRY
# think of ways to move into salsas or toppings from here - not sure? feel like this is getting all too conditional
# after you solidify this code - think of adding docs
